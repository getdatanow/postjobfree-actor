Our first product (Sohu) only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200. With Etched ASICs, you can build products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep chain-of-thought reasoning.  DevOps Infrastructure Engineer Designing and writing software for new ASICs is hard, and requires a huge amount of software and tooling. It is even more challenging for model-specific ASICs, as it is important for them to hit the market at the right time, and thus moving fast is essential. You will drive adoption of cutting-edge tooling, to improve the speed and reliability of our toolchains. You will help us innovate to do better than the industry norm, by running massively parallel CI jobs, specifying and building our own fully-redundant SSD-only server infrastructure, and making sure these tools run automatically and reliability. You will work with an IT contracting firm to do the day-to-day maintenance and installation - while you must be knowledgeable enough about IT to work with this firm, most of your time will be spent designing new toolchains entirely The scope and title of this role can be modified for exceptional candidates. Representative projects ● Spec out a server using a 6 GHz desktop CPU to speed up single-threaded workloads ● Decide if moving our servers to the cloud/a colo facility makes sense to improve uptime ● Set up networking infrastructure to allow Jupyter notebook users to connect to our servers, without waiting for them to be restarted. ● Parallelize our CI stack to run on dozens of different machines at once, designing a policy to avoid unnecessary CI failures if a machine goes down. You may be a good fit if you ● Are highly technical ● Strong knowledge of Linux, containerization, CI/CD, and programming languages such as Python/C++. You will be asked coding questions during your interview. ● Proven ability to lead technical teams and mentor junior members ● Have 4+ years of experience with either infrastructure engineering or software development ● Experience debugging complex hardware and software issues with server infrastructure Strong candidates may also have experience with ● In-depth understanding of workflows used in the semiconductor industry, especially those involving Synopsys and Cadence EDA tooling and Verilator ● Proficiency with cloud computing technology and experience working with a Big 3 Cloud ● Experience monitoring and installing datacenter hardware ● In-depth understanding of workflows used in the semiconductor industry, We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. How we’re different: Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs. We are a fully in-person team in Cupertino, and greatly value engineering skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed. Benefits: Full medical, dental, and vision packages, with 100% of premium covered, 90% for dependents Housing subsidy of $2,000/month for those living within walking distance of the office Daily lunch and dinner in our office Relocation support for those moving to Cupertino"

        "location": "New York, NY",
        "description": "Coast is re-imagining the trillion-dollar U.S. B2B card payments infrastructure, with a focus on the country’s 500,000 commercial fleets, 10 million commercial vehicles, and 4 million commercial drivers. The incumbent technologies that cater to these customers are decades old, and drivers, fleets, and the merchants that serve them all increasingly demand modern digital experiences and affordable and transparent financial services products. Coast's mission is to deliver them at a transformational scale, and to improve working lives in one of the country’s biggest industry sectors. The company is backed by top fintech and mobility venture funds. Coast is competing and winning with software, and we are building a world-class engineering team. We are looking for front-end, full-stack, backend, and platform engineers. This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground level early on, contribute and learn in myriad ways, make key decisions, expand your impact as the business grows, have fun, and learn a ton in the process. If you're practical and business-minded, smart and creative, and excited about the rewards and the energy of an early-stage venture-backed startup, we'd love to hear from you. In order to maximize the velocity of our product engineering, we are hiring in NYC and the tri-state area only. Our office is located in the heart of Manhattan’s NoHo neighborhood, benefiting from its vibrant creative energy. The Platform Engineer role is critical to Coast and could be described with any of DevOps, SRE, or Infrastructure titles. In this role you will be an early member of the platform engineering team. The platform you build will enable velocity, scalability, and observability, both at the operational and organizational level. Working directly with an enthusiastic and invested product team, you will design, implement, maintain, and improve our tooling, from build and end-to-end testing to release and rollback automation, from network security to multi-region resiliency, from scalability to observability. At the end of the day, we want to establish the “paved paths” with automation and processes that make it easy for product engineering to do the right thing and strike the balance between freedom and responsibility. After joining Coast, here’s how your first few months will look: Week 1: We use OKRs to help us focus, and Kanban to organize day to day work - you will start picking up small improvements off the board and contribute across our IaC, observability, and CICD ecosystems; We treat infrastructure as code, so we expect you to get your first story merged by the end of the week after passing automated checks and peer review; You will establish the cadence of 1x1s with your manager. Month 1: Write your first Terraform module start-to-finish; Build and Deploy a new observability pattern; Add a new CI pipeline; Contribute to planning, retrospectives, code reviews; Write your first design document for a major feature. Month 2: All of the above, but also you will get to do your first dev talk; Establish your development goals with your manager. The Platform Engineer will: maximize the velocity for our product engineering team by simplifying their infrastructure concerns, from speedy build and deployment to cross-region availability, from email deliverability to network security practices; influence design and implementation of all aspects of our product, from data engineering infrastructure to product architecture, from code sharing patterns to developer tooling; hold a high bar for quality, discipline, and organization of the underlying infrastructure; evangelize, advocate, lead and promote the best practices, whether it is Zero Trust networking or SLOs; shape the infrastructure and platform aspects of our product by listening to what the engineering teams are asking for, even if they don’t know the words to describe it; work to evaluate and integrate critical third-party software and infrastructure including the payments and mobility stacks; help shape the engineering culture of the company; remain relentlessly pragmatic and balance the product velocity demand with the needs of a well-managed platform. The Platform Engineer must: have 7+ years experience working with first-class engineering teams with a proven track record of consistent and frequent delivery of quality software to production; have experience working directly with product engineers to incrementally improve our practices; be proficient in at least one language ecosystem (Python, Ruby, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go), since you would be expected to contribute platform aspects into product engineering code as well as write your own tools; have experience with one of Terraform/CloudFormation/Pulumi/CDK since we treat our infrastructure as code; deep hands-on knowledge and experience developing in the cloud (preferably AWS) with container management solutions (Kubernetes, ECS); be able to figure stuff out - the modern infrastructure space is deep and complex, and there are many ways of solving the same problem. You need to be able to go off on your own, research and design a solution, implement technical spikes, and then deliver it with the team; have an owner mindset and continuously look for, notice, and implement improvements to our infrastructure, because small continuous improvements matter; be a thought-leader that keeps a finger on the pulse of the industry - latest CNCF graduates, trends in CICD, networking, security, vendor landscape; have a clear philosophy of how to structure cloud infrastructure/ecosystems to promote security, velocity, and reliability. Compensation Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of our total compensation package that also includes benefits, signing bonus, and equity. Pay decisions are based on a number of factors, including scope and qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to other Coast employees. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at Coast to fall healthily within the range based on these factors. Salary range: $160,000 - $185,000 annually Signing bonus Equity grant: commensurate with level determined at the discretion of the company, with meaningful potential upside given the company’s early stage Benefits overview: Medical, dental and vision insurance Unlimited paid time off (vacation, personal well being, paid holidays) Paid parental leave $400 accessories allowance (a keyboard, mouse, headphones, etc.) Free lunch every Friday About Coast Coast is founded and led by Daniel Simon, who previously cofounded Bread (breadpayments.com), a leading payments and credit technology firm backed by some of the world’s top VCs which was acquired for $500MM+ in 2020.
